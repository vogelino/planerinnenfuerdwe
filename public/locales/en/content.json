    "introductionMD": "The socialisation of housing is a concern for architecture, particularly for practitioners in Berlin, because an affordable city will determine how we live, and how we work.\n\nWe are a group of young architects and planners who study, live, and work in this city. We support the popular campaign to expropriate residential property companies—Deutsche Wohnen, Vonovia, Akelius, Ado among them—who own over 3000 residential units in order to convert these properties to affordable, socially controlled and democratically managed housing for all.\n\nThis would be achieved by buying back a government-assessed cost of the units, ideally at the DW&cE campaign's suggested €8b price tag, repaid over decades with fair rent costs of the ~240,000 released units, without putting the government in debt*",
