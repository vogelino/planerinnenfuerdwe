      Architects and Planners open letter of support for the Deutsche Wohnen &
      Co Enteignen Campaign
    </h1>
    <p className='mb-4'>
      The socialisation of housing is a concern for architecture, particularly
      for practitioners in Berlin, because an affordable city will determine how
      we live, and how we work.
    </p>
    <p className='mb-4'>
      We are a group of young architects and planners who study, live, and work
      in this city. We support the popular campaign to expropriate residential
      property companies—Deutsche Wohnen, Vonovia, Akelius, Ado among them—who
      own over 3000 residential units in order to convert these properties to
      affordable, socially controlled and democratically managed housing for
      all.
    </p>
    <p className='mb-4'>
      This would be achieved by buying back a government-assessed cost of the
      units, ideally at the DW&cE campaign&apos;s suggested €8b price tag,
      repaid over decades with fair rent costs of the ~240,000 released units,
      without putting the government in debt*
    </p>
    <br />
    <p className='mb-4'>
      Architects and planners play an important role in the discussion about the
      future of Berlin. We want to participate and decide what we build - and
      not be merly a service for a global network of real estate coorperations.
    </p>
    <p className='mb-4'>
      The housing problem is omnipresent in the city. Free markets didn&apos;t
      proof to be the solution within the last ten years. For us housing
      isn&apos;t a commodity!
    </p>
    <p className='mb-4'>
      We want experiements. We want alternative culture. We want alternative
      concepts of living. We don&apos;t live in Berlin because of luxurious
      apartments and the city didn&apos;t became famous for its glassed office
      towers.
    </p>
    <p className='mb-4'>
      It&apos;s clear that the housing situation is in a crisis. Homelessness
      has grown by XX, rents in Kreuzberg have increased by XX% in the last ten
      years, and there is a need for XXX apartments in this city. Berlin&apos;s
      housing is in a critical condition.
